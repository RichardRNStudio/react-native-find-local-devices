<blockquote>
<p>It can be helpful when you try to get a list of your local devices over WiFi when the devices includes at least one websocket connection.</p>
<p>This package allows you detect all devices over your local network with websocket connection.</p>
<p>You've to add a timeout and an array of ports as parameters. The package will try to create a connection with those ports and return the ip adresses which have successful connection.</p>
