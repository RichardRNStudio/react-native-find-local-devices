</p>

<p>This package allows you detect all devices over your local network with websocket connection.</p>
<p>You've to add a timeout and an array of ports as parameters. The package will try to create a connection with those ports and return the ip addresses which have successful connection.</p>
<p>NOTICE: It doesn't work with IOS yet. Related ticket: <a href="https://github.com/RichardRNStudio/react-native-find-local-devices/issues/2">IOS support ticket</a></p>

```

<h2>Usage</h2>

```ts
import PortScanner from 'react-native-find-local-devices';

const scanner = new PortScanner({
    timeout: 40,
    ports: [8000],
    onDeviceFound: (device) => {
      console.log('Found device!', device);
    },
    onFinish: (devices) => {
      console.log('Finished , devices:', devices);
    },
    onCheck: (device) => {
      console.log('Checking IP: ', device.ipAddress);
    },
    onNoDevices: () => {
      console.log('Finished scanning, no results have been found!');
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      // Called when no service found
      console.log('Error', error);
    },
  });

  // You can start the discovering with the following function:
  scanner.start();

  // When the discovering is running, you can cancel that with the following function:
  scanner.stop();
