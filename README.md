<blockquote>
<p>This package allows you detect all devices over your local network with websocket connection.</p>
<p>You've to add a timeout and an array of ports as parameters. The package will try to create a connection with those ports and return the ip addresses which have successful connection.</p>
<p>See the example: <a href="https://github.com/RichardRNStudio/react-native-find-local-devices/tree/main/example">https://github.com/RichardRNStudio/react-native-find-local-devices/tree/main/example</a></p>
<p>NOTICE: It doesn't work with IOS yet. Related ticket: <a href="https://github.com/RichardRNStudio/react-native-find-local-devices/issues/2">IOS support ticket</a></p>
